Context :-

classify the type of triangle for each record in the TRIANGLES table based on the lengths of its sides

Steps :-

1- Check if the sides form a triangle: A set of three sides ùê¥ , ùêµ, and ùê∂ forms a triangle if the following conditions are met:


    ùê¥ + ùêµ > ùê∂

    ùê¥ + ùê∂ > ùêµ

    ùêµ + ùê∂ > ùê¥


2- Classify the triangle:

   Equilateral: All 3 sides are equal.

   Isosceles: 2 sides are equal.

   Scalene: All 3 sides are unequal.
